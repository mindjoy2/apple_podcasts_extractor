# apple_podcasts_extractor
This project is an HTML page that enables users to search for and download audio from Apple Podcasts. With this code, users can easily download their favorite podcast episodes directly from Apple Podcasts, and can either try out the demo URL (https://mindjoy.neocities.org/podcast/apple/) or download and run the HTML file locally.

To use the code, you must specify the URL of a CORS Proxy. The default CORS Proxy URL is "https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/," but you will need to request temporary access permission from the site to use it. Once you have access to the CORS Proxy, simply input the name of the Apple Podcasts episode you wish to download and the code will handle the rest.

Overall, this project provides a convenient way for users to download audio from Apple Podcasts and makes it easy to access your favorite episodes quickly and efficiently.
